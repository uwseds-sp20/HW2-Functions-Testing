# HW2 - Using Functions and Testing

Create a Python module (a file with extension ‘.py’) with the following functions:

1. Write a Python module that creates a Pandas dataframe from a URL that points to a CSV file.

1. Create the function test_create_dataframe that takes as input: (a) a pandas DataFrame and (b) a list of column names.
The function should hold True if the following conditions hold:

  - The DataFrame contains only the columns that you specified as the second argument.
  - The values in each column have the same type.
  - Verify that the dataframe has at least one row.

1. Use a Python testing framework (unittest, nosetest, etc.) to replicate the function in the above question.

1. Provide a screenshot (.png) of successfully running the tests.
